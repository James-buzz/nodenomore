## Why should you use this?

- `node_modules` directories often take up a significant amount of disk space, and they can accumulate quickly across different projects.
- Developed with ease of use in mind, while ensuring specificity in targeting only unnecessary `node_modules`.

## Install

```
npm install -g nodenomore
```

## Usage

Simply navigate to the directory where your `node_modules` are stored and type:

```
nodenomore
```

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from Node.js official website.
- It’s advisable to have npm (Node package manager) updated to the latest version.

## Safety Measures

Nodenomore has been designed to avoid accidental deletions. It double-checks with you before removing any `node_modules` directories.
